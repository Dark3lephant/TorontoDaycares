# Toronto Child Care Finder

 A tool to help you sort through the madness that is finding care for your child in Toronto. While this doens't fix any of the systemic issues that causes the shortage, I hope it makes your search easier. 

## Disclaimers

1. This project utilizes City of Toronto's [Open Data Portal](https://open.toronto.ca), spefically [Licensed Child Care Centres](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/licensed-child-care-centres/) dataset. 

2. While this is a convenient tool to search, I recommend checking other sources as I've seen daycare centres in my area missing from this dataset (they were Ontario licensed, I checked).

3. You will need to download and install Power BI desktop to use this. Power BI is a complex data analysis software, but *you don't need to know Power BI* to use the daycare finder. Everything is setup in a user-friendly dashboard. 

4. Yes, I know Ontario Ministry of Education has a daycare finder here: https://www.earlyyears.edu.gov.on.ca/LCCWWeb/childcare/search.xhtml but it is seemingly built to make parents desparate to find care for their children suffer just a bit more. You can either see a list, or pins on Google maps. You would think that you can click on the pins to show the daycare information but NOPE!

## Install PowerBI

You can install by downloading the excecutable from [this link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494) or get it from [Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/pbidesktopstore).
